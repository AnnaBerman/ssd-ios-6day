# BCIT ssd-ios-6day
This repo will be updated with each set of lecture notes as well as any assets referenced within.

### Please note, that while I have uploaded the 6 days of lecture material for your early review...the format and contents of each lecture may change prior to delivery (but the general concepts and learning outcomes will remain the same)
